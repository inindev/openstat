The goal of the OpenStat project is to utilize off-the-shelf hardware to build a reliable and flexible thermostat.

The current iteration of this project uses [RTH9580WF01](https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=iot1OeLFV0f%2Fi%2Bsbj98nGQ%3D%3D&) hardware. This hardware is marketed using Honeywell model numbers: [TH9320WF5003](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=TH9320WF5003) and [RTH9585WF1004](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=RTH9585WF1004)
